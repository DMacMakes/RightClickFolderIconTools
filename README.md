**Batch proccessing and change folder icon using keyword**<br> 
     For batch processing, RCFI Tools allows you to change the icons of multiple folders using a keyword.
  1. Place the image you want to use as the folder icon inside each folder.<br>
  2. Define a keyword by right-clicking and selecting "Folder Icon Tools" > "Define Keyword".
  3. Enter the keyword that RCFI Tools will use to search and select the image.<br>
      For example:
      if the image inside each folder is named like _"`Movie_name_(year)_-_Poster.jpg`"_ then you can use `*Poster.jpg` as the keyword so RCFI Tools will search for images with filenames matching the keyword and set them as the folder icon.
  4. To batch process all folders in the current directory, right-click on an _empty space_ and choose "Folder Icon Tools" > "Generate from Keyword". Alternatively, you can also manually select each folder you want to change the icon.<br>
